# happy-number
If the repeated sum of squares of the digits of a number is equal to 1, it is considered to be happy.

```
For Example:

23 is a happy number, as:

2 ^ 2 + 3 ^ 2 = 13
1 ^ 2 + 3 ^ 2 = 10
1 ^ 2 + 0 ^ 2 = 1


Sequence of happy numbers: 1, 7, 10, 13, 19, 23, ...
``` 

If the sum of squares of digits reaches 4, 1 can never be reached thus making the number unhappy or sad.

### Tasks:

* (Easy) Write a program to verify whether a given number is happy or not.

* (Medium) Write a program to find all the happy numbers in a range.

* (Hard) Given a number, write a program to verify whether it's happy or not and to display every sum of squares operation performed till the result is obtained.

* single-number : Verify whether a given number is disarium or not.
* numbers-in-a-range : Find all the disarium numbers in a range.
